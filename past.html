            <h1>Past Experiences: Computing </h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            My experiences in coding started in highschool. My first ever coding experience is 
            in learning the python language, with very minimal knowledge but the eagerness to 
            know how to start my coding journey. 
        </p>

                <ul>
                  <td> <li>Software Design and Development - we learnt the bare basics of coding but not actually coding. We learnt the basics of binary and pseudocode.</li>
                    <li>Multimedia - Not really similar and no coding involved but there was a an aspect of the subject where you had to create a project in which i used code.</li></td>
                    <td><li>Bachelors of Information Technology (Unfinished)</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate Certificate of Game Design - Finished</li></td>

        <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
        <p>My work right now doesn't really implement much technological aspects but I do work with computers with a software that allows us to book patients into the system</p>
