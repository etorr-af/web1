            My experiences in coding started in high school. My first exposure was to the Python language. 
            I had very minimal knowledge at the time, but I was eager to start my coding journey.

                My current job doesn't heavily involve technology, but I work with computers using a patient booking system software. 
                It helps us manage appointments and client data efficiently.
