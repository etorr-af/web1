                <h2>Webpage Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    The overall structure of this website follows a clear and consistent layout across all pages to ensure ease of navigation and maintainability. Each page uses semantic HTML5 elements to improve readability for both developers and assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;:</strong> Declares the document type to ensure consistent rendering across browsers.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;:</strong> These elements define the main structure of each webpage.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;:</strong> Contains the site’s title and navigation links, repeated on each page for consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;nav&gt;:</strong> The navigation bar allows users to access different sections/pages of the website easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;section&gt;:</strong> Used to group related content into logical blocks (e.g., hobbies, K-pop, games, technicalities).</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;div&gt;:</strong> Helps organize content within each section and apply specific styles using CSS classes.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;table&gt;:</strong> Used to organize and present information in a structured and easy-to-read format.</li>
                    <li><strong>&lt;footer&gt;:</strong> Appears at the bottom of each page with acknowledgements or reference notes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using this consistent structure across all pages not only improves the user experience but also makes the website easier to update and maintain.
