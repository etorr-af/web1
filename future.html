        <p>
            As for my future. I aspire to be successful in the computing industry.
            Whether it would be in Cybersecurity or perhaps creating and designing 
            games/software. As well as my aspirations to have a future in the computing
            field, I can see myself pursuing something in the medical field as well. This being 
            Nursing or a Surgeon. This type of position has interested me due to the tv show "The 
            Good Doctor". Ever since starting this show, it has inspired me and peaked my interest
            in operating as a surgeon.
